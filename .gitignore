# Sensitive variable definitions
# It's generally best practice to keep terraform.tfvars out of version control
# if it contains sensitive data or environment-specific values.
# If your tfvars contains ONLY non-sensitive, shared defaults, you *might* commit it.
# However, for labs or personal projects, you might commit it for convenience.
# For production, definitely ignore.
# If you commit it, remove the '#' from the line below.
